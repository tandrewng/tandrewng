### Hi, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a new grad developer from Canada. I have experience building web applications and services. I also enjoy learning about cutting edge technology in my free time.

With all the new hype around AI Iâ€™m currently learning various topics in the field and how to effectively use the tools.

I recently worked on a Wildlife Categorization Tool which you can view below and interact with <a href="https://tandrewng.github.io/Wildlife-Categorizer-Web/">here<a>
